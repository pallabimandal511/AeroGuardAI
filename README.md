# 🚀 AeroGuard AI – AI-Powered Digital Twin for Aero Engine Health Monitoring

An intelligent, software-based digital twin prototype designed for health monitoring, fault detection and mission reliability analysis of aero piston engines used in MALE (Medium Altitude Long Endurance) UAVs.

AeroGuard AI demonstrates how engine sensor data can be monitored and analysed in real time to identify abnormal conditions, simulate engine faults, calculate engine health scores and provide explainable maintenance recommendations through an interactive dashboard.

## 📌 Overview

**AeroGuard AI** is designed to simplify aero piston engine health monitoring through a virtual engine representation and an interactive monitoring dashboard.

The system demonstrates how important engine parameters can be analysed to identify potential operating abnormalities before in-flight failure occurs.

### Users can:
* **Monitor** engine temperature, oil pressure, vibration and RPM in real time.
* **View** a virtual CAD schematic matrix representation of an aero piston engine.
* **Simulate** 6 different engine fault conditions using the onboard Fault Injection Panel.
* **Detect** abnormal sensor readings using physical demonstration limits.
* **Calculate** an illustrative engine health score (0–100 pts).
* **Analyse** an illustrative mission reliability score (0–100%).
* **Receive** explainable fault alerts and prescriptive maintenance suggestions.
* **Visualize** historical sensor trends and live dual-harmonic vibration waveforms.
* **Download** generated monitoring reports as a CSV file.

> **Note:** The current prototype uses simulated sensor readings and explainable rule-based fault detection. Real engine sensor hardware integration and validated predictive analytics are future engineering enhancements.

### Sensor Parameters

The system monitors four core engine parameters:

| Parameter | Nominal Range | Warning Limit | Purpose |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Engine Temperature** | 70°C – 105°C | > 110°C | Monitors engine operating temperature & cooling efficiency |
| **Oil Pressure** | 45 – 75 PSI | < 30 PSI | Monitors engine lubrication system pressure |
| **Vibration** | 1.0 – 5.0 / 10 | > 7.0 / 10 | Identifies abnormal engine & airframe vibration |
| **RPM** | 2200 – 4800 RPM | > 5000 RPM | Monitors engine rotational speed against approved envelope |

## 🧪 Fault Injection Scenarios

The Fault Injection Panel allows users to test how the application responds to different simulated abnormalities:

| Fault Type | Simulated Condition | Detection Logic | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spark Plug Misfire** | Vibration spikes to 8.2/10, RPM drops to 2600 | Vibration > 7.0 | Simulates improper ignition of the fuel-air mixture. |
| **Oil Pressure Drop** | Oil pressure drops to 18.0 PSI | Oil Pressure < 30 PSI | Simulates a decrease in engine oil lubrication pressure. |
| **Engine Overheating** | Temperature rises to 128.0°C | Temperature > 110°C | Simulates an abnormal increase in engine temperature. |
| **Abnormal Engine Vibration** | Vibration elevates to 9.1/10 | Vibration > 7.0 | Simulates unusual engine structural vibration. |
| **High RPM** | Engine speed reaches 5450 RPM | RPM > 5000 | Simulates engine speed exceeding approved limits. |
| **Sensor Failure** | Out-of-range reading (`ERR_OOR`) | Validity Range Check | Simulates missing, invalid or disconnected sensor telemetry. |

## 🧠 Engine Health & Reliability Analysis

### 1. Engine Health Score (0–100 pts)
The demonstration scoring system starts with 100 points and deducts penalties for abnormal readings:
* **75–100 pts:** `HEALTHY` (All parameters within safe envelope)
* **50–74 pts:** `WARNING` (One or more parameter threshold breaches)
* **Below 50 pts:** `CRITICAL` (Severe or multiple concurrent abnormalities)

### 2. Mission Reliability Score (0–100%)
The mission reliability module separately evaluates four weighted factors:
1. **Lubrication Reliability (35% weight)**
2. **Thermal Endurance (25% weight)**
3. **Structural / Vibration (25% weight)**
4. **Powertrain Speed (15% weight)**

Condition brackets:
* **75–100%:** `GOOD CONDITION`
* **40–74%:** `CAUTION`
* **Below 40%:** `HIGH RISK`

*These scores are illustrative indicators and are not validated predictions of actual aircraft engine reliability or mission success.*
